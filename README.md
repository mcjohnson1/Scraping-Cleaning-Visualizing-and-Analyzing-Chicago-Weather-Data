# Scraping-Cleaning-and-Visualization-of-data
With the current focus on global climate change, I decided to see if there were any noticeable changes in Chicago's weather patterns over the span of my lifetime. I scraped the historical weather data from [weather underground](https://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/KMDW/2018/2/7/MonthlyHistory.html?&reqdb.zip=&reqdb.magic=&reqdb.wmo=). I chose to scrape three pieces of data: Mean Temperature, Max Temperature, and Min Temperature. Using this information I found the average temperature of each year, the minimum temperature in January of each year, and the hottest temperature of the summer months. From there I created a scatter plot of each, allowing the data to be analyzed and interpreted.
